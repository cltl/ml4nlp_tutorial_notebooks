# Tutorial notebooks - Machine Learning for NLP course

This website contains the tutorial notebooks for the course Machine Learning for NLP, which is part of the Language in AI Master at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The course is taught by [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/), assisted by [Pia Sommerauer](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/pia-sommerauer) and [Leon Eshuijs](https://watermeleon.github.io/). 
These pages and notebook are created by [Leon Eshuijs](https://watermeleon.github.io/).

The goal of these pages is to walk you through the different algorithms discussed in the course and provide you with coding examples of how to use these. Importantly, these pages are generated from Jupyter Notebook files, and I encourage you to run them locally (or via a cloud service such as Google Colab), so that you can play with them. When running them yourself, it can be helpful to run the notebook once, and then modify the code: create new cells, check what each variable is (e.g. type(var)), check what its shape is, and modify it for another task. Only by playing with it yourself can you become confident you understand and can use them yourself.
