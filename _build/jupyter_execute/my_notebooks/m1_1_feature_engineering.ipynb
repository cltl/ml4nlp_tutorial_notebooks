    "### What is a Feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. In machine learning, features are the input variables used to make predictions. For problems in NLP what a feature to use is heavily dependend on the task we are trying to complete. For example for named entity recognition, where we aim to check if a word or substring refers to a named entity, it might be relevant if this string starts with a capital letter. Of course since many other non-entity words also start with a capital (such as the first word in a sentence), based on the feature `is_capitalized` we might now know for sure if the word refers to a named entity, thus it is useful to have many different features. In general we distiguish between a few different types of features based on the values it can take, below is a list of the different categories of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Features\n",
    "1. **Numerical Features**: Continuous or discrete numbers\n",
    "2. **Categorical Features**: Discrete categories or labels\n",
    "3. **Binary Features**: True/False, Yes/No, 1/0\n",
    "4. **Text Features**: Words, characters, n-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Can you identify the type of features for the instance below?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "house_instance = {\n",
    "    'city': 'Amsterdam', \n",
    "    'rooms': 3,\n",

    "Let's start with example of numerical data, taking the NLP side a bit more loosly and focusing on a more general machine learning problem to keep it simpler. Let's say we have some measurements from different weather stations in the Netherlands, for each weather station we have some information stored: temperature and humidity measurements.
